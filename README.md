## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- npm (v9 or higher)
- MongoDB

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lakhwinderr/Open-Source-Discovery.git
   cd Open-Source-Discovery
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in ./backend directory and configure the necessary variables for MongoDB connection and GitHub API access.
   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN
   MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING
   ```
4. **Start the Development Server**

   First make sure to start backend server
   ```
   cd backend
   node index.js
   ```
   Then go to main project folder and run development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open the Application**

   The application should be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

6. **Build for Production**

   To build the application for production, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   The optimized files will be in the `build` directory.

2. **Star/Unstar Repositories**

   - Click on the "Star" button to mark repositories you find interesting.
   - The repository is added to your starred list for future reference.

3. **View Repository Details**

   - Click on any repository to view details such as its stars, forks, and programming language.

## Challenges & Setbacks

While working on this project, I faced challenges such as setting up authentication, handling deletion and updates in the database, and adding pagination for repository lists. These features are planned for future updates.
